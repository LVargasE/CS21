# Software Sales
#
# INFO:
#
# Companies will create software and then set a retail price that the end user
# will pay.  In order to get retailers to buy in large quantities and then be
# able to make a profit, the creator of the product will offer quantity
# discounts.  Usually, the more you buy, the larger the discount.
#
# These can be assembled into a table that will show the quantities and the
# corresponding discounts.
#
# We will be using a function and some decision structures.
#
# The Program Spec:
#
# A software company sells a package that retails for $99.  Quantity discounts
# are given according to the following table:
#
# Quantity	Discount
# 10 - 19	20%
# 20 - 49	30%
# 50 - 99	40%
# 100 or more	50%
#
# The company will ask customers to enter the number of packages that they
# want to purchase.  The program will should then display the amount of the
# discount, if any, and the total amount of the purchase.
#
# 1 - Create a global constant for the retail price of the package
# 2 - Create a main that asks the user for the number of packages and then
#   calculates the discount and total for the purchase in the order specified
#   above.
# 3 - Create a function named showPurchase(discountAmount, totalAmount): that
#   will
#   print out the discount and total amount with titles.
# 4 - Be sure to include comments in your code.
# 5 - Run the program at least 4 times times with different numbers of
#   packages to show that your discounts are working and include it as output
#   with your program.
#
# Should look like:
# >>>
# Enter the number of packages purchased: 4
# Discount Amount: $ 0.00
# Total Amount: $ 396.00
# >>>
